These files are provided as a template to allow users to connect to Vodafone UK's VoIP network. Please modify to suit your username, password, provided proxy server and client.

Note that a firewall rule should also be added to permit inbound UDP traffic to port 5065, ideally only from IPs used by Vodafone.

If experiencing any issues, please check that your router is not modifying the TOS values. Packets without correct values will be dropped.
